# 05 — Implementation Roadmap

A phased plan to get from today's SPA to the new Next.js site with minimal risk. Each phase
has a clear "definition of done." Phases are sequential; within a phase, items can overlap.

> **Working rules apply to every phase** — see [07-engineering-rules.md](07-engineering-rules.md):
> TDD red→green (1), documented as we go (2), Docker-local + Cloud Run deploy (3), and **you QA in
> the browser after each step** (4). Each phase's checklist items are themselves browser-QA-able
> steps; **"Done when"** below assumes tests green + your browser sign-off + docs updated.

> **Gate before Phase 1:** ~~confirm the data/CMS fork~~ **DECIDED: Option A (Payload + Postgres)**.
> Roadmap assumes A.

## Phase 0 — Setup, Docker & deploy pipeline  (1 day) — 🟢 mostly done (2026-06-28)

- [x] Fresh repo scaffolded at repo root: **Next.js 16.2.7 + Payload 3.85.1 + Postgres** (blank
      template, pinned to published versions, Node 22, npm).
- [x] **Docker first:** `docker-compose.yml` (Next.js `app` + `postgres:16` with healthcheck) +
      multi-stage `Dockerfile` (`output: 'standalone'`). `docker compose up` → `localhost:3000`.
      ✅ Verified: `/` → 200, `/admin` → 200 (Payload booted, schema pushed to Postgres).
- [x] **`deploy.sh` / `deploy.ps1`** to **Google Cloud Run** (project `gen-lang-client-0797455311`)
      + `.dockerignore`. Scripts written; not yet run (needs gcloud auth + Secret Manager).
- [x] Test harness wired: **Vitest** integration green (3 tests pass in-container). Playwright e2e
      config present (runs in CI).
- [x] **git** initialized + initial commit; `.gitattributes` (LF normalization).
- [x] **GitHub Actions CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Postgres service → `npm ci` → lint +
      `test:int` (hard gates) → e2e (non-blocking for now); deploy job to Cloud Run on green `main`.
- [x] **Legacy data exported** → `migration/` (1 project "Shop Truck" + decoded before/after JPGs;
      no custom shop doc). Reusable script at `scripts/export-legacy-firestore.mjs`.
- [x] Docs: app `README.md`, `docs/workflows/local-dev.md`, `docs/workflows/deploy.md`, `migration/README.md`.
- [ ] **Remaining (needs your accounts):** provision **Neon Postgres** + **GCS** bucket access +
      **Resend**; add repo secret `GCP_SA_KEY` + Secret Manager `DATABASE_URI`/`PAYLOAD_SECRET`;
      first real deploy to a live Cloud Run URL; create the GitHub remote and push.
- **Done when:** ✅ hello-world + admin **QA-able at `localhost:3000` in Docker**, ✅ sample test
  green, ✅ CI + export + git in place; ⏳ live Cloud Run URL (pending cloud provisioning).

## Phase 1 — Foundation & design system  (1–2 days)

- [ ] Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 scaffolding.
- [ ] Port the **design tokens** (dark `#070708`, gold `#eab308`, mono/italic type) and shared
      components: header, footer, logo/gear, buttons — each with a component test (red→green).
- [ ] Base layout, fonts, global styles.
- **QA in browser:** home shell renders with correct branding at `localhost:3000`.
- **Done when:** the home shell looks like the current site, server-rendered, tests green, QA'd.

## Phase 2 — CMS + data model + access roles  (3–4 days)

- [ ] Install Payload, connect Postgres, define collections (`vehicles`, `media`, `inquiries`,
      `settings`, `estimatorConfig`) per [03-data-model.md](03-data-model.md); wire **GCS** uploads.
- [ ] **Pull Phase 8 forward:** `users` + `admin`/`owner` roles + `vehicle.owner` + access
      functions, with access-control tests written **red first** (highest-risk surface).
- [ ] Create your owner login; migrate exported content; re-upload key photos at full res.
- **QA in browser:** log in to `/admin`, see/edit your real builds + story; confirm a non-owner is
  denied.
- **Done when:** `/admin` shows your real content editable, access tests green, QA'd.

## Phase 3 — Public site  (3–4 days)

- [ ] Home page (hero, featured builds, story) reading from the CMS.
- [ ] **Showroom** grid with category filtering.
- [ ] **Vehicle spec-sheet page** `/vehicles/[slug]`: cover, **photo gallery + lightbox**,
      before/after slider, spec table, story, CTA.  ← includes the requested gallery.
- **Done when:** every build has its own indexable page with a working photo gallery.

## Phase 4 — Lead capture  (1–2 days)

- [ ] Contact form (`/contact` + per-vehicle CTA) → server action.
- [ ] Save `inquiry` + email you via Resend; honeypot + rate limit.
- [ ] Admin inquiries inbox with status triage.
- **Done when:** a test submission emails you and appears in the admin inbox.

## Phase 5 — SEO & polish  (1–2 days)

- [ ] `generateMetadata` per page, `sitemap.ts`, `robots.txt`.
- [ ] JSON-LD: `LocalBusiness` on home, `Vehicle`/`Offer` on builds.
- [ ] Open Graph / share images, alt text, performance pass (Core Web Vitals).
- [ ] Vercel Analytics + Google Search Console.
- **Done when:** Lighthouse SEO ~100 and the sitemap lists all builds.

## Phase 6 — Estimator  (1–2 days)

- [ ] Port the interactive estimator; move the Gemini call server-side.
- [ ] Drive its options from `estimatorConfig` so prices are CMS-editable.
- **Done when:** the estimator works without exposing the API key.

## Phase 7 — Launch  (½–1 day)

- [ ] Final content review; publish builds.
- [ ] Point `120customs.com` DNS at Vercel; verify SSL.
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console; set up Google Business Profile.
- [ ] Keep the old site reachable until the new one is verified, then cut over.
- **Done when:** 120customs.com serves the new site and Google can crawl it.

## Private Garage Ledger track (budget / parts / invoices / maintenance)

The full subsystem is specified in [06-build-budget-and-parts.md](06-build-budget-and-parts.md).
It's **private (admin/owner only)** and **not required for the public launch**, so by the stated
priority (get found + inquiries first) it lands **after Phase 7**. It can move earlier if you'd
rather have the build-tracking tooling sooner — say the word and we resequence.

> **Foundation note:** the **roles + `owner` + access-control** work (Phase 8) should be done
> before or alongside Phase 2's CMS setup if we know the Ledger is coming — it's cheaper to add
> the `users` role + `vehicle.owner` field up front than to retrofit. Flagged here so it isn't
> missed.

### Phase 8 — Roles, ownership & access control  (1–2 days)

- [ ] `users` collection with `admin`/`owner` roles; add `vehicle.owner` relation.
- [ ] Payload access functions: private collections readable/writable only by admin or
      `vehicle.owner`; public queries locked to published showcase fields.
- [ ] `transferLog` + an admin "transfer vehicle to user" action.
- **Done when:** a non-owner test user cannot see another vehicle's ledger; transfer reassigns access.

### Phase 9 — Categories, stores & parts  (2–3 days)

- [ ] `partCategories` CRUD (seeded: driveline, diff, engine, body, electrical, …).
- [ ] `stores` CRUD with `aliases` (seeded: Rock Auto, Summit, Jegs, …).
- [ ] `parts` collection + manual add/edit UI; filter by category/store/status.
- **Done when:** you can manually build a parts list for a vehicle.

### Phase 10 — Running budget dashboard  (1–2 days)

- [ ] Per-vehicle rollup: spent-to-date, by category, by store, vs `budgetTarget`.
- [ ] Planned vs actual; charts; vehicle Ledger landing view.
- **Done when:** adding/removing parts updates the budget live.

### Phase 11 — AI invoice ingestion  (2–4 days)

- [ ] Private invoice upload → file kept in private Blob storage.
- [ ] Gemini structured extraction (vendor, dates, totals, line items) via server action.
- [ ] Auto-match store (aliases), suggest category per line; owner review/confirm UI.
- [ ] Confirm → line items become `parts` linked via `sourceInvoice`.
- **Done when:** uploading a real invoice produces a reviewable parts table and keeps the PDF.

### Phase 12 — Maintenance log + AI recommendations  (2–3 days)

- [ ] `maintenanceRecords` (type, mileage, items, costs, optional receipt file).
- [ ] Gemini next-service recommendations from history + mileage; upcoming-maintenance reminders.
- **Done when:** logging an oil change records the parts/consumables and surfaces next-due advice.

## Rough total

Public site (Phases 0–7): ~**2–3 weeks** part-time, front-loaded on Phases 1–3. Private Garage
Ledger (Phases 8–12): ~**1.5–2.5 weeks** more, with the AI invoice phase the largest single
piece. Phase 8 (roles/ownership) is the one bit worth pulling forward into Phase 2.

## Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Photo originals lost (current ones are 800px base64) | Re-shoot/re-upload best builds at full res; old images work as placeholders meanwhile |
| Data migration mistakes | Export first, migrate into a preview env, verify before launch |
| SEO dip at cutover | Keep slugs sensible, submit sitemap immediately, 301 any changed URLs |
| Scope creep (testimonials, e-commerce) | Out of scope for v1; the data model leaves room to add later |

## Explicitly out of scope for v1

Testimonials/reviews, full e-commerce/checkout, multi-user roles, blog. All are easy to add
later on this architecture.
